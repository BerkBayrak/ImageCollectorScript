# ImageCollectorScript
This Python script works with the Album Chrome extension to collect images from any web page. Copy the &lt;img> tags using the Mosaic option, paste them into an HTML file, and run the script. Images are saved with numeric filenames starting from zero; move them to avoid overwriting.
